# Banoffee Pie Recipe

An easy family favorite with buttery pastry and sweet dulce de leche. Serve with a generous dollop of cream.

## Ingredients

### For the filling:
- 4 bananas, sliced
- 394g caramel (or dulce de leche)
- 300ml double cream
- Dark chocolate (optional, for garnish)

### For the pastry:
- 100g chilled butter (plus extra for greasing)
- 200g plain flour
- 1 medium egg, separated
- 1 tbsp golden caster sugar

## Method

1. **Make the pastry case:**
   - Put butter and flour in a food processor and pulse until it resembles fresh breadcrumbs.
   - Add the egg yolk and sugar, pulse again until mixed.
   - Add cold water one tbsp at a time until dough just comes together.

2. **Knead and chill:**
   - Knead dough gently to form a smooth ball.
   - Wrap in cling film and chill for 30 minutes.

3. **Prepare the tart tin:**
   - Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 4.
   - Grease a 23cm loose-bottomed fluted tart tin.
   - Roll out the pastry and line the tin, leaving some pastry proud of the edge.

4. **Bake the shell:**
   - Line with baking parchment and baking beans.
   - Bake for 15 minutes, remove paper and beans.
   - Brush with beaten egg white.
   - Bake for another 15-20 mins until golden and cooked through.
   - Cool completely (can be done a day ahead).

5. **Assemble the pie:**
   - Spread half the caramel on the pastry case.
   - Layer on the sliced bananas.
   - Cover with remaining caramel.
   - Chill in the fridge.

6. **Finish and serve:**
